### What is ML ?
  
It is a type of **Artificial Intelligence** that allows software applications to learn from data and become more accurate in predicting outcomes without **human interventions**.
  
eg : Whether a piece of fruit in a picture is a orange or an apple, spotting people crossing the road in front of a self-driving car and taking actions accordingly, whether an email is a spam or not, or to generate captions for a YouTube video.
  
**What’s requires to create good machine learning systems ?**
1) Data Preparation capabilities
2) Algorithms — basic and advanced
3) Automation and iterative processes
4) Scalability
5) Ensemble Modeling
  
### Applications of ML
  
- Image Recognition
- Self Driving Cars
- Product Recommendation
- Stock Market Prediction
- Online Fraud Detection
  
#### Spam Detection
