### What is ML ?
  
It is a type of **Artificial Intelligence** that allows software applications to learn from data and become more accurate in predicting outcomes without **human interventions**.
  
eg : Whether a piece of fruit in a picture is a orange or an apple, spotting people crossing the road in front of a self-driving car and taking actions accordingly, whether an email is a spam or not, or to generate captions for a YouTube video.
  
**What’s requires to create good machine learning systems ?**
1) Data Preparation capabilities
2) Algorithms — basic and advanced
3) Automation and iterative processes
4) Scalability
5) Ensemble Modeling
  
### Applications of ML
  
- Image Recognition
- Self Driving Cars
- Product Recommendation
- Stock Market Prediction
- Online Fraud Detection
- Spam Email Detection
- Online Customer Service
  
### Types of ML
  
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Semi-supervised Learning
  
#### 1) Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labelled data, in which input and its desired output are known. Supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical data predicts future events. For example, it can anticipate when credit card transactions are likely to be got cancelled or which insurance customer is going to file a claim.
  
**Important supervised algorithms**
  
- K-nearest neighbors
- Linear regression
- Support vector machines
- Logistic regression
- Decision trees
- Random forests
  
#### 2) Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is used against data that are unclassified or unlabeled. The system does not know the “right answer”. The goal is to explore the data and find some structure within. Unsupervised learning works well on transactional data. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms allow users to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning.
  
**Important unsupervised algorithms**

- Clustering: k-means, hierarchical cluster analysis
- Association rule learning: Eclat
- Visualization and dimensionality reduction: kernel PCA, t-distributed, PC
